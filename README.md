# Eyeopener

This website I created together with classmate: Mil√®ne Jacobs as part of the second period of the second year. The goal was to create an online interactive story about the social side of the energy transition. I created the website, while she created the illustrations. Unfortunately the website cannot be displayed via github, because it is based on PHP.
